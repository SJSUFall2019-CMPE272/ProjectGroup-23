1)Project Title: USA's city based health analytics

Description: We have a lot of new health issues emerging in the current
world like those which we have never faced before and we are still unable
to decide upon what causes these diseases. Our project would help identify
the diseases along with all the factors causing it like: bad air quality of the city,
unclean water, garbage congestion etc. We have a dataset of 500 cities in the USA
along with the number of people in that city which are affected by a particular
disease. So we have count for the number of people suffering from a particular disease
in a particular state. Then we also have data for various diseases and their symptoms or causes.
So then we can train the system to perform computations over the given data and
provide the user with the analytics regarding what all factors in that particular city 
are leading to causing a particular disease.

Goal:
This analytics can be then submitted to city health department which can then identify
the causes for the bad health of the people living there and then correspondingly make
changes to improve the health of the people of the  city.

Technology stack:
Python, MongoDB/OracleDB, Docker/Kubernetes, ReactJS,


2)Project Title - Smart Meter

Project Idea Description:- 
a. Electricity Utility Providers are faced with the challenge of meeting up with the demands of consumers throughout the day. Most importantly, the demands that occur during the peak hours of the day. Since, electricity cannot be stored in bulk, these utility providers daily face the challenge of reducing the gap between supply & demand of electricity units in those peak hours.

b. Inspired by the above issue, we hope to build a Model that can work to reduce the load demands during the peak hours of the day by subtly shifting the demands to non-peak hours, while taking into consideration factors such as customer satisfaction, maximum supply limit of utility, monetary costs, etc. 

c. The core of the idea is development of a Load Scheduling Model that can optimally meet the demands of both the consumers & the utility providers. To enable the full potential, we hope to monitor & schedule appliances of household via our model by making use of IoT. 

d. Along with shifting of loads to non-peak hours, model would also take into consideration the overall cost reduced in user's electricity bill along with the comfortability level of the user with the proposed schedule.

e. The idea holds scope for implementation of the Model for an entire community of households with One Master metering unit communicating with each household's individual smart meter for reducing the load during peak hours for an entire community. 


Goal of the Project:- 

The goal of the project would be to reduce the peak hours load of consumers by shifting the load during non-peak hours by providing them with incentives. Thus we would want to reduce the Peak-to-Average-Ratio (PAR) of a consumer's load profile so that it can be flattened as much as possible. Thus reducing the peak demands would directly benefit the utility providers in meeting the demands of all consumers without looking for options of building new generation systems and bigger storage units thus incurring huge additional investment. Consumers would also be directly benefitted by this model with savings in their monthly electricity bills and a satisfaction of saving of environment with their minimal efforts. 

Technology Stack (Tentative):-

Evolutionary Algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization), Dynamic Programming, Node, React ,AWS (EC2, ECS) , Docker, Database (MongoDB/Cockroach DB)
